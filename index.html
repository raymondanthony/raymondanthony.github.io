<p>Marginally more meaningful than lorem ipsum content this exists to serve a purpose that purpose is not first and foremost 'human consumption' and so by nature of its purpose does not and rarely would possess qualities of other seemingly similar documents that by nature of their existence might place emphasis on the elements that this document or series of documents specifically by design has chosen to not include or include at random. the elements include grammatical style and structure, proper spelling for the referenced language, fluidity of content recognizable prose, typeface and fonting, imagery and pleasing aesthetics. countless other elements not necessary to list. for the sake of its actual intended as well its realized secondary uses it is an actual random stream of thought that may change abruptly so that the content is random in subject and application of proper grammar, but besides those items both of which may and likely will by nature of this type of document make themselves known, the content is more than nonsensical and will even be be more or less straightforward, then again it may not.</p>

<p>If you are looking for me in a contributory or sharing sense this is not likely it. youtube which i visit and utilize to view the standings of the people earning money I could use from the millions of hits on the same videos I was forced to remove, and i am their like clockwork for 30 minutes out of each 3 hour waking period of free time I allot myself translation, roughly once per month. if i were to be heavily using Git networks Atlassian is a better spot and I would hazard to guess maybe 1000 other companies agree. Scratch that nearly all companies based outside of amsterdam and san francisco and not including the millions also throughout the world pretending with fake area codes to be in san francisco, or the fogies or ten years behind Indians on svn, all companies would contrary to what they might say instinctively and by nature of their purpose and fiduciary oaths of its officers implied by the articles of incorporation, prefer atlassian and other services offering privacy controls for those not fortunate enough to have transcended the bondage of capitalism, and thus can not in goood conscious legally, or financially open their books to the san francisco open source dream, it (bitbucket) fills in the gaps left behind by this site, no disrespect to Tom intended in its own way GH is quite beyond awesome, and has already changed the world in ways most people may never realize, as it leverages the seemingly primal need to share information but unlike other networks focuses on only the meaningful content with a minimum of bullshit. justin bieber does not have an acount here. enough said, nor does charlie sheen, rhianna or anybody else i can think of that offends me more than the smell of death. though that will likely change-the bieber part, not the smell of death part.</p>

<p>Given the speed at which this space is growing the prudent thing to do is claim it. If the space is ranked and it is, across relevant terms in the top 5 consistently, it should be utilized like so at least, at a minimum. engagement is always a plus, activity, etc.  side note, without this in my experience the attempt will be in vain at best and a trend I predict will be that it will increasingly become scored down if only to offset references that con-volute the facts the algorithm in this case google is of concern, uses to make its determinations.</p>

<p>If you are looking for how to harness the advantages without said risks, you might follow the lead and create senseless content whilst leveraging the many obvious advantageous the network offers and honestly github is pretty awesome, should be and is often used with the meager privacy options offered with overpriced pay for accounts, written off as advertising expense then under an alias organization of an alias user, I recommended a a series hierarchical stacks in this fashion amidst stacks of free, and then linking off site via bash script or node collected repo string via the awesome API as I have done, then utilizing what you need off site and having the ability to push back commits of importance to a true git where the aforementioned concerns are not a factor again, atlassian is such a place. used in conjunction with local or ssh'd cloud based servers with extended bucket storage in encrypted mysql filesystems  and lxc contained instances of assets is my own chosen solution and allows for the iterable instantiation of asset fleets and templates of fleets/assets. Allowing one to affordably and if 'mad' conceive of develop and implement in preproduction by ones self in between architecting the end individual assets which are in the form of websites, even at 2 in the morning. this model for enterprise scale has been tested and therefore does in fact stil work when implemented with a $150 laptop and a marginal internet connection coupled with a pair of hacked 4g devices to serve as routers, if you happen to be an ex pat on the beach in a 3rd world country, while unwittingly thrust into war with existing partners who have lost their goddamn minds and overlooked by friends and family, and consequently unable to make your current months rent and electricity payments and are contemplating jumping off your 12th story balcony. This also works quite well in the absence of proper funding for hardware software and human resources. This balancing act is not without complication and hardship but is one of a few achievements of the fictitious company X as one small aspect of the as of yet not being compensated for work for the very real company Y which is currently enjoying soaring profits from the 208 number one listings on google, 100% of which we previously unlisted, and this phenomenal disparity is all credited to the work that merely has led to the aforementioned techniques which have been developed as a means to template some of the foundation parts at a mass scale, and for clarification are being architected and documented literally in between development of the actual end assets, which are websites intended to be parts of 'circles' of sites that share links.</p>

<p>other than that please dont read to carefully into this as again, its place holder content intended to be marginally more meaningful than lorem ipsum, unless you actually get what I am talking about in which case feel free to attempt to contact me for the sake of my own curiosity that anybody would, or for clarification regarding your own setup or a managed process with a walk through or to skip the bullshit and just attempt to achieve the end result and get ranked on top for a fee which I would not be opposed to doing for your organization. Now that it includes a reference to, however far reaching and remote the possibility a door open at least to a potential revenue stream given that understated solicitation, it is in keeping with my personal doctrine of the moment that everything should  large or small contribute back as revenue or if not applicable or appropriate as reference to increase popularity, credibility or authority of extended assets that do contribute or may contribute revenue potential, this document can end.</p>
